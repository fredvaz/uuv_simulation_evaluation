# Simulation evaluation tools for the UUV simulator

This is a complementary package to the [UUV Simulator package](https://github.com/uuvsimulator/uuv_simulator)
with tools that allow running the simulation from a Python script and compute
KPIs and store ROS bags. It can be used to use the simulation wrapper to start
a simulation scenario from a Python script in application for optimization
purposes, machine learning and other similar tasks.

Status of the master branch:
